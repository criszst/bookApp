# What is this project?
Its a small book app made with React Native
(Project for React Native studies)
<br />

Inspired by “ [LCRN EP6 - Book Store App - React Native UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEI38Pa8ZYM) ”
<br />
However, I've been changing the layouts and adding new components and functions


# Functions
- Search for books with the Google Books API and show their details

- Read a free sample of a book with the Google Books service
